    <a href="09/20/further-jenkins-setup-code-signing.html">Further Jenkins Setup for iOS</a>
  </h5><p>Last <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/blog/2012/09/16/setting-up-jenkins-on-os-x/">time</a> I went through how I set up jenkins on iOS and built a simple static library. All in all, that process went ok. The next step was to build an actual app. Unfortunately I encountered a lot more issues with this.</p>

<p>The first error I got was </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Code Sign error: The identity 'iPhone Developer' doesn't match any valid certificate/private key pair in the default keychain` 
</code></pre></div>
<p>This <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/9246321/1131820">post</a> on Stack Overflow has a really detailed set of instructions on how best to fix this. Unfortunately as my iPhone developer account is not a business one, I can&#39;t add a jenkins user to it. So to solve my problem I added my certificate to the system keychain so that now my local jenkins user can access it.</p>

<p>Once that was out of the way, the next issue to rear its head was a provisioning profile error. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Code Sign error: A valid provisioning profile matching the application's Identifier '...' could not be found
</code></pre></div>
<p>I found the solution to this again on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/10454628/1131820">Stack Overflow</a>.
I needed to copy my provisioning profile from <code>~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning</code> to the jenkins user&#39;s folder at <code>/Users/Shared/Jenkins/Home/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles</code>.</p>

<p>The next reason for the build failing was that I was invoking xcodebuild using a target instead of a scheme. The target worked fine for the static library but was failing for the app as it was unable to find all the include files. Once I switched to building a scheme, the build worked fine. Building via a scheme or target is easy to configure using the Jenkins XCode plugin. You set the XCode Schema File entry to the name of the XCode build scheme.</p>

<p>Nearly there! Now that the build was working I turned my attention to getting the unit tests running. The <code>TEST_AFTER_BUILD</code> flag that had worked before wasn&#39;t working this time. Fortunately I found the solution on Peter Jihoon Kim&#39;s <a href="http://www.raingrove.com/2012/03/28/running-ocunit-and-specta-tests-from-command-line.html">blog</a>. I needed to create a new scheme to run my tests. Once that was done I got this error</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Tools/Tools/RunPlatformUnitTests:95: warning: Skipping tests; the iPhoneSimulator platform does not currently support application-hosted tests (TEST_HOST set).
</code></pre></div>
<p>Peter&#39;s blog describes the fix for this. You need to patch the <code>RunPlatformUnitTests</code> file in order to remove the warning printout and invoke the tests.</p>

<p>The last error I had to deal with was with the code coverage. I started seeing errors with <code>fopen$UNIX2003</code> and <code>fwrite$UNIX2003</code>. I had seen this issue on other blogs before but hadn&#39;t encountered it myself until I tried building an app using the command line. The solution as described <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/8732393/1131820">here</a> is to add implementations of these into your application which simply call the standard C functions.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

FILE *fopen$UNIX2003( const char *filename, const char *mode )
{
    return fopen(filename, mode);
}

size_t fwrite$UNIX2003( const void *a, size_t b, size_t c, FILE *d )
{
    return fwrite(a, b, c, d);
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>One unresolved issue was that I couldn&#39;t get clang scan plugin working for this setup. I think the issue here is that it was using targets instead of schemes. I left this one go as I didn&#39;t feel it important enough to get working. XCode runs this while I&#39;m developing anyway. I may come back to it in future once everything else is stable.</p>

<p><strong>XCode 4.5 Updates</strong></p>

<p>So, just when I got everything working for XCode 4.4, along comes XCode 4.5. Ever since the 4.2 to 4.3 transition broke code coverage for me, I&#39;ve been a bit wary of XCode updates. Sure enough after installing 4.5 and trying to build my app, I got an error message saying that the calabash framework was missing a armv7s slice
    ld: file is universal (2 slices) but does not contain a(n) armv7s slice: 
    ...calabash.framework/calabash for architecture armv7s
<a href="http://calaba.sh">Calabash</a> is part of an iOS testing framework based on <a href="http://cukes.info">Cucumber</a>. I&#39;ve just started to implement this form of testing and it looks really nice. Getting back to the build issue, Ash Furrow has a detailed <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/fix-ios-6-sdk-linker-error">post</a> on this issue. We need to remove armv7s (which refers to the new A6 chip in the iPhone 5) from our valid architectures. Once Calabash gets updated to support this architecture, I can reenable it.</p>

<p>Once everything built in XCode, it was time to try the jenkins build. Naturally this broke also. The problem was that the XCode plugin couldn&#39;t find the 5.1 simulator. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>xcodebuild: error: SDK "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator5.1.sdk" cannot be located.
</code></pre></div>
<p>XCode 4.5 had wiped out the simulators for 5.1 so I needed to redownload them. I was able to download these from Preferences-&gt;Downloads-&gt;Components. XCode also prompted me to download the 6.0 simulator so I got that out of the way while installing 5.1.</p>

<p>Once the simulators were installed I started hitting the same <code>RunPlatformUnitTests</code> error as above. When I opened the script file to reinsert Peter&#39;s edits I saw that it had changed slightly. Now the error printout was happening in a function on line 80 which overrode <code>RunTestsForApplication()</code>. I deleted that function and I added back in the original patch at line 118 so that now it looks like</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>if [ "${TEST_HOST}" != "" ]; then
    # All applications are tested the same way, by injecting a bundle.
    # The bundle needs to configure and run the tests itself somehow.
    export CFFIXED_USER_HOME="${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/UserHome/"
    mkdir -p "${CFFIXED_USER_HOME}"
    mkdir -p "${CFFIXED_USER_HOME}/Library/Caches"
    mkdir "${CFFIXED_USER_HOME}/Library/Preferences"
    mkdir "${CFFIXED_USER_HOME}/Documents"
    export OTHER_TEST_FLAGS="${OTHER_TEST_FLAGS} -RegisterForSystemEvents"

    RunTestsForApplication "${TEST_HOST}" "${TEST_BUNDLE_PATH}"
else
    # If no TEST_HOST is specified, assume we're running the test bundle.

    RunTestsForBundle "${TEST_BUNDLE_PATH}"
fi
</code></pre></div>
<p>These changes fixed the 4.5 build issues and now I have a working build and test setup again. Finally!!</p>

  <h5>
    <a href="09/16/setting-up-jenkins-on-os-x.html">Setting up Jenkins on OS X</a>
  </h5><p>First post in a long time. I didn&#39;t really do much iOS development over the summer and am only starting to get back into it in the past few weeks. I have some draft posts on my dealings with both Core Data and UITableViews and once those features are complete I&#39;ll post them.</p>

<p>Along with coding, I&#39;ve been looking at adding some build infrastructure for my projects. Having seen <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> used at work, I wanted to get a CI system set up for my builds here at home. I want to use it to kick off a build, run the tests and package up the iPhone app. By using something like Jenkins I can automate my build and testing process and also have a record of previous builds.</p>

<p><strong>Jenkins Install</strong></p>

<p>The first step was to install Jenkins. They provide a Mac installer - the only annoyance is that it triggers the new OS X Gatekeeper dialog blocking unsigned apps from installing. Then I loaded locahost:8080 in my browser to find that Jenkins wasn&#39;t loading and there was no error message telling me what went wrong. D&#39;oh. The issue is that Jenkins requires Java to run but it isn&#39;t installed by default on OS X. To install simply type <code>java</code> into a terminal and a message box will appear prompting you to install Java.</p>

<p>Then I followed the user setup from Moritz Haarmann&#39;s <a href="http://momo.brauchtman.net/2011/11/12/howto-install-jenkins-on-os-x-and-make-it-build-mac-stuff/">blog</a>. I&#39;m not sure if the jenkins account part is still necessary, as when I got to the stage about changing the user name in the plist file, it had already been set to Jenkins. The changing permissions on the Jenkins home folder was needed though. After that I was able to run ssh-keygen and generate some keys.</p>

<p><strong>Updating Git Workflow</strong></p>

<p>I installed the Git and XCode plugins from the Manage Jenkins screen with no issues. I then created a simple project to test it out. I just added a git clone step. This failed for me with the following errors</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Failed to connect to repository : Command "git ls-remote -h ..../MyApp.git HEAD" returned status code 128:
stdout: 
stderr: fatal: '..../MyApp.git' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
</code></pre></div>
<p>The problem here is that the repository is on my Dropbox account (as described <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/blog/2012/01/26/version-control-in-xcode-using-git-and-dropbox/">here</a>). This folder is not visible to the jenkins user. I didn&#39;t want to mess around with changing permissions on the Dropbox folder so I looked for an alternative solution. A colleague at work told me about <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> from Atlassian. This is similar to <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a> but allows for private repositories. As luck would have it, I had already been using another Atlassian product <a href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a> to manage my git repositories. This tool works seamlessly with Bitbucket. Once I uploaded my ssh key to Bitbucket I could simply add another remote repository to my local repository and push to it, all from within SourceTree.</p>

<p>Now that I had a repository on Bitbucket, it was time to integrate that with Jenkins. This turned out to be fairly easy. I uploaded the ssh key for the jenkins account to Bitbucket. The admin page for the repository showed its ssh address so I added a Git build step to the project using that ssh address. When the project is built now, Jenkins will download the latest code from the repository first and then continue on.</p>

<p><strong>Jenkins Issues</strong></p>

<p>While Jenkins is mostly working fine now, there were a few issues I&#39;ve run into. The git checkout isn&#39;t working at all using the Git Plugin. Originally it did but then I started getting the following errors
    FATAL: Could not checkout null with start point 02dbc3e456d6aa6079543eeaa8361bdebe8fac9d
    hudson.plugins.git.GitException: Could not checkout null with start point 02dbc3e456d6aa6079543eeaa8361bdebe8fac9d
        at hudson.plugins.git.GitAPI.checkoutBranch(GitAPI.java:956)
        ...</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Caused by: hudson.plugins.git.GitException: Command "git checkout -f 02dbc3e456d6aa6079543eeaa8361bdebe8fac9d" returned status code 128:
stdout: 
stderr: fatal: reference is not a tree: 02dbc3e456d6aa6079543eeaa8361bdebe8fac9d
</code></pre></div>
<p>I wasn&#39;t able to find a solution to this so I had to stop using the Git plugin and just add an <code>execute shell</code> build step to clone the Bitbucket git repository. As I add more projects to Jenkins, I&#39;ll check if I get the same issues there also.</p>

<p><strong>Build XCode Project</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.XXX.com">XCode plugin</a> for Jenkins made it really easy to build once setup. You add an XCode build step and configure it as necessary. I chose to do a clean build each time. The project I tested this on was a static library so I didn&#39;t need an IPA built or any of the version number updates but they should be useful when building a proper app.</p>

<p>When I first tried to build I got an error saying <code>You have not agreed to the Xcode license agreements</code>. I needed to run <code>sudo xcodebuild -license</code> in the terminal to fix this.</p>

<p>In order to run the unit tests, the XCode plugin recommends using two build steps, one to build the app and the other to execute the tests. The reason for this is that the test step requires extra parameters i.e. path to the simulator SDK. If you&#39;re using the OCTest framework which comes with XCode then the plugin will listen to the test output and generate JUnit compatible xml files. Jenkins can read these and add the to the build results page.</p>

<p><strong>Set up Coverage</strong>
Setting up code coverage for iOS projects is not an easy task. My gcov setup for XCode 4.3 still worked for me but the problem was to integrate this with Jenkins. Coverstory would not be of use here but I found this <a href="https://software.sandia.gov/trac/fast/wiki/gcovr">gcovr</a> script from the <a href="http://blog.octo.com/en/jenkins-quality-dashboard-ios-development/">Octo Talks</a> blog. Gcovr will convert the gcov output into a <a href="http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/">cobertura</a> xml file which can be read by Jenkins.</p>

<p>One problem I had was that for some reason, gcov wouldn&#39;t work on the files in the Jenkins workspace. I was getting <code>gcno:cannot open graph file</code>errors. Coverstory also didn&#39;t work on the files in this location. What worked for me was to copy the gcda and gcno files out to a temp folder under /Users/Shared/Jenkins/Home. Passing the original build location as the root parameter to gcovr allowed the cobertura plugin to find the source code in the html report, while also removing system headers from the coverage report. Here is the script.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>cp -r ${WORKSPACE}/build/${JOB_NAME}.build/Coverage-iphonesimulator/${JOB_NAME}.build/Objects-normal/i386/*.gc* /Users/shared/Jenkins/tmp/${JOB_NAME}
cd /Users/shared/Jenkins/tmp/${JOB_NAME}
gcovr -r $WORKSPACE/$JOB_NAME -x &gt; ${WORKSPACE}/coverage.xml
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <a href="http://blog.octo.com/en/jenkins-quality-dashboard-ios-development/">Octo Talks</a> blog also suggested a number of other metrics which could be captured in Jenkins. I added the SLOC Count and the Clang Build Scan. Both of these required installing tools and then Jenkins plugins which used those tools. This instructions on the blog covered this. Ones that I&#39;ve put on the someday/maybe list are the PMD plugin and OCLint.</p>

<p>At the end of all this, Jenkins is working quite well for my simple test project. Next step is to try it out on my app.</p>
