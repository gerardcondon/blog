Get the density so that we can put in proper bus and cycle infrastructure. Leave the traffic choked sprawl to other cities."

I used this [guide](https://medium.com/@bertinjoseb/replace-playstation-classic-stock-games-from-internal-memory-easily-e3307b09b0d8) to replace the games on the system. You can use a usb drive which is safer but I preferred to get rid of the dreck that comes with it. Now to add in some proper games."

The emulation is fine for the most part. There is a bit of corrupted graphics on the initial load screen. Some (but not much) of the audio sounds distorted/crackly. Since installing Vagrant Story, I've basically just spent my time playing the game rather than installing additional ones! Will really need to add the rest of the games sometime."
