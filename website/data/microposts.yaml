I used this [guide](https://medium.com/@bertinjoseb/replace-playstation-classic-stock-games-from-internal-memory-easily-e3307b09b0d8) to replace the games on the system. You can use a usb drive which is safer but I preferred to get rid of the dreck that comes with it. Now to add in some proper games."

The emulation is fine for the most part. There is a bit of corrupted graphics on the initial load screen. Some (but not much) of the audio sounds distorted/crackly. Since installing Vagrant Story, I've basically just spent my time playing the game rather than installing additional ones! Will really need to add the rest of the games sometime."

It's a print and play game with grid maps and D&Dish combat. I was looking for something that my son could use his Warhammer miniatures with as the main Warhammer rules are way too complicated. This reminds me of the old Heroquest boardgame (I wish they still made that!). Even my 3.5 year old enjoyed playing it."

No problem I can just go back right - no, only at a certain stage of the game. Well that's not too bad - and we've placed a really hard boss with 800K HP blocking it. Ah feck. Made the same mistake on the PS2 when it first came out."
