            </h5>
            <p>It&#39;s been a year, give or take, since I started looking into iOS development, and I wanted to write a post to reflect on where I am and what are the next steps.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Progress on iOS to Date</strong></p>
            
            <ul>
            <li><p>I spent the first three months of the year learning Objective C and hacking on some small programs. </p></li>
            <li><p>I spent some time experimenting with Core Data and MVC and trying to get an automated testing system up and running.</p></li>
            <li><p>The summer months were quiet due to work commitments. The project I was working on switched to JavaScript which I hadn&#39;t really used before. Due to this, I spent a lot of time learning JavaScript and web frontend and backend development.</p></li>
            <li><p>After the summer I came back to the app with a better understanding of MVC as implemented in iOS and Core Data and I started working on it again. I read up on TDD and started implemented tests using Cucumber and Calabash. That took me up to about October.</p></li>
            <li><p>Work has stalled on it since then due to a combination of real life commitments from both family life and work. And also Skyrim! Curse you Skyrim and the hours I sank into it :)</p></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Current Status</strong></p>
            
            <p>Here&#39;s where I am currently</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li><p>App work: I didn&#39;t get as much done as I had planned at the start of last year. I got diverted in other areas, namely: </p></li>
            <li><p>Testing - TDD &amp; BDD: I hadn&#39;t planned to look at any of this but ended up spending a lot of time here and learning a great deal. Familiarizing myself with this way of programming was probably the biggest benefit I gained from the last years experimentation. I probably could have completed the app if I didn&#39;t spend so much time on TDD and tinkering with automated testing setups on Jenkins. However I wouldn&#39;t have learned anywhere near as much about proper programming techniques if I did.</p></li>
            <li><p>JavaScript: I spent a good deal of time learning proper JavaScript development. The basic syntax is very similar to Java which I already knew. However I wanted to learn how to program using JavaScript correctly i.e. modular code using RequireJS, TDD using Jasmine etc.</p></li>
            <li><p>Ruby and Rails: again I had not planned on researching any of this but I got interested in it while looking at JavaScript. Have done a few tutorials and would like to write a Rails app at some stage.</p></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I spent a lot of time over the last year becoming proficient in web app and backend development in JavaScript for a work project. I&#39;ve been really enjoying this. My only previous experience of JavaScript and web development was back in college around 2000 and I wasn&#39;t too taken with it compared to Java and C development. But looking at it now and in combination with backends like Rails, I&#39;ve been really impressed. I&#39;m kind of kicking myself for tuning out on what was happening in web development over the past decade. I plan to branch out and do some posts on what I used to ramp up on this.</p>
            
            <p>On the iOS front I feel that I have a good knowledge of Objective C. However the issue is finding time to finish the app. Any time I was able to set aside a sizable chunk of time I got a lot done but getting that time is the key.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
            
            <p>I think working on this side project has made me expand my horizons more as a developer. I couldn&#39;t have predicted the areas that I would have become interested in at the start of last year. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a coincidence that as I&#39;ve started looking at more stuff outside of work, that my work projects have become more interesting. I feel like I&#39;m able to bring so much more to a project now especially in the areas of TDD and design.</p>
            
            <p>Admittedly I haven&#39;t pursued the iOS work 100%, but I feel that the other languages I&#39;ve been exposed to compensate for that. I think it was better to start out with iOS and then divert into other topics rather than not do any side work at all.</p>
            
            <p>However at the end of the day the reality is that I haven&#39;t shipped anything on iOS yet. I&#39;ve been justifying this to myself by claiming all these other intangible benefits. Given what I&#39;ve learned, I don&#39;t think that I&#39;ve wasted my time but still I&#39;d like to get some iOS project finished. Unfortunately given my current life and work commitments I probably won&#39;t have time to work on it over the next three months. In the meantime, I&#39;ll post about my JavaScript and TDD experiences.</p>
            
            <p>As regards the blog, looking back I am happy enough with what was posted in the past year. The main thing I&#39;m not happy with is the regularity of the postings. The same things that have stopped me doing much software work, have also stopped me publishing much. In future I want to maintain a more regular posting rate. I aim to post at least once a fortnight and hopefully once a week.</p>
